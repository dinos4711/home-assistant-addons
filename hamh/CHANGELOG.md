> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ⚠️ **Project Status: End of Maintenance**
>
> As of **January 2026**, this project is no longer actively maintained.
>
> I previously announced a search for a new maintainer, but unfortunately no one has stepped forward
> to take over the project. Due to personal time constraints, I am no longer able to continue development or provide support.
>
> **What this means:**
> - ❌ No further feature development
> - ❌ No bug fixes or updates
> - ❌ No guaranteed support
>
> The repository will remain available for reference and forking.
>
> 💡 I would be very happy to see this project continued by the community.  
> If you plan to fork it and continue development: **may the best fork prevail.**
>
> Thank you to everyone who used, tested, and contributed to this project ❤️
